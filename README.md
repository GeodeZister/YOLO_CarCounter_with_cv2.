The YOLO-CarCounter-with-cv2 project is a vehicle detection and counting system that utilizes the power of YOLO (You Only Look Once) for object detection, and OpenCV for video processing and drawing detected objects and informational overlays on the video feed.

The system has the ability to detect vehicles like cars, trucks, buses, and motorbikes with high accuracy in real-time. After detection, it assigns unique IDs to each vehicle and tracks their movement across frames. Furthermore, it implements a virtual line in the video, and counts the vehicles crossing this line, providing a simple yet effective vehicle counting system.

An example of how the program works:
